    Blockfrost is an API as a service that allows users to interact with the
    Cardano blockchain and parts of its ecosystem.


    ## Tokens


    After signing up on https://blockfrost.io, a `project_id` token is
    automatically generated for each project.

    HTTP header of your request MUST include this `project_id` in order to
    authenticate against Blockfrost servers.


    ## Available networks


    At the moment, you can use the following networks. Please, note that each
    network has its own `project_id`.

    ## Milkomeda

      <span>
        For more information about how to use Milkomeda as well as the list of available endpoints, see the <a href="https://blockfrost.dev/start-building/milkomeda" target="_blank">Milkomeda section</a>.

    ## Concepts


    * All endpoints return either a JSON object or an array.

    * Data is returned in *ascending* (oldest first, newest last) order, if not
    stated otherwise.
      * You might use the `?order=desc` query parameter to reverse this order.
    * By default, we return 100 results at a time. You have to use `?page=2` to
    list through the results.

    * All time and timestamp related fields (except `server_time`) are in
    seconds of UNIX time.

    * All amounts are returned in Lovelaces, where 1 ADA = 1 000 000 Lovelaces.

    * Addresses, accounts and pool IDs are in Bech32 format.

    * All values are case sensitive.

    * All hex encoded values are lower case.

    * Examples are not based on real data. Any resemblance to actual events is
    purely coincidental.

    * We allow to upload files up to 100MB of size to IPFS. This might increase
    in the future.

    * Only pinned IPFS files are counted towards the IPFS quota.

    * Non-pinned IPFS files are subject to regular garbage collection and will
    be removed unless pinned.

    * We allow maximum of 100 queued pins per IPFS user.


    ## Errors


    ### HTTP Status codes


    The following are HTTP status code your application might receive when
    reaching Blockfrost endpoints and

    it should handle all of these cases.


    * HTTP `400` return code is used when the request is not valid.

    * HTTP `402` return code is used when the projects exceed their daily
    request limit.

    * HTTP `403` return code is used when the request is not authenticated.

    * HTTP `404` return code is used when the resource doesn't exist.

    * HTTP `418` return code is used when the user has been auto-banned for
    flooding too much after previously receiving error code `402` or `429`.

    * HTTP `425` return code is used in Cardano networks, when the user has
    submitted a transaction when the mempool is already full, not accepting new
    txs straight away.

    * HTTP `425` return code is used in IPFS network, when the user has
    submitted a pin when the pin queue is already full, not accepting new pins
    straight away.

    * HTTP `429` return code is used when the user has sent too many requests in
    a given amount of time and therefore has been rate-limited.

    * HTTP `500` return code is used when our endpoints are having a problem.


    ### Error codes


    An internal error code number is used for better indication of the error in
    question. It is passed using the following payload.


    ```json

    {
      "status_code": 403,
      "error": "Forbidden",
      "message": "Invalid project token."
    }

    ```

    ## Limits


    There are two types of limits we are enforcing:


    The first depends on your plan and is the number of request we allow per
    day. We defined the day from midnight to midnight of UTC time.


    The second is rate limiting. We limit an end user, distinguished by IP
    address, to 10 requests per second. On top of that, we allow

    each user to send burst of 500 requests, which cools off at rate of 10
    requests per second. In essence, a user is allowed to make another

    whole burst after (currently) 500/10 = 50 seconds. E.g. if a user attempts
    to make a call 3 seconds after whole burst, 30 requests will be processed.

    We believe this should be sufficient for most of the use cases. If it is not
    and you have a specific use case, please get in touch with us, and

    we will make sure to take it into account as much as we can.


    ## SDKs


    We support a number of SDKs that will help you in developing your
    application on top of Blockfrost.

        Pinning is necessary to avoid regular garbage collection (deletion) of
        IPFS objects. Non-pinned objects are regularly being removed without
        prior notice. Pinned objects are counted in your user storage quota.


        **Note:** If the object was pinned to Filecoin (using `filecoin=true`),
        it cannot be removed or unpinned due to Filecoin's immutable and
        persistent storage guarantees. Please ensure careful consideration when
        pinning objects to Filecoin, as the action is irreversible.

                      When the object is pending retrieval (i.e. after

                      If the object is already successfully retrieved, state is
                      changed to `pinned` or `failed` otherwise.

                      When object is unpinned (i.e. after

                      collection.

                      State `gc` means that a previously `unpinned` item has
                      been garbage collected due to account being over storage

        **Note:** If the object was pinned to Filecoin (using `filecoin=true`),
        it cannot be removed or unpinned due to Filecoin's immutable and
        persistent storage guarantees. Please ensure careful consideration when
        pinning objects to Filecoin, as the action is irreversible.
