  summary: Pin an object
  description: |
    Pinning is necessary to avoid regular garbage collection (deletion) of IPFS objects. Non-pinned objects are regularly being removed without prior notice. Pinned objects are counted in your user storage quota.

    **Note:** If the object was pinned to Filecoin (using `filecoin=true`), it cannot be removed or unpinned due to Filecoin's immutable and persistent storage guarantees. Please ensure careful consideration when pinning objects to Filecoin, as the action is irreversible.

        If set to true, the object will be pinned to Filecoin as well. If not specified, the object will only be pinned to IPFS. Objects pinned to Filecoin cannot be unpinned due to its long-term storage guarantees.
