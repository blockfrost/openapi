                    State of the pinned object, which is `queued` when we are retriving object. If this
                    is successful the state is changed to `pinned` or `failed` if not. The state `gc` means the
                    pinned item has been garbage collected due to account being over storage quota or after it has
                    been moved to `unpinned` state by removing the object pin.
