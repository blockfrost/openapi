                  State of the pinned object. We define 5 states: `queued`, `pinned`, `unpinned`, `failed`, `gc`.
                  When the object is pending retrieval (i.e. after `/ipfs/pin/add/{IPFS_path}`), the state is `queued`.
                  If the object is already successfully retrieved, state is changed to `pinned` or `failed` otherwise.
                  When object is unpinned (i.e. after `/ipfs/pin/remove/{IPFS_path}`) it is marked for garbage collection.
                  State `gc` means that a previously `unpinned` item has been garbage collected due to account being over storage quota.
